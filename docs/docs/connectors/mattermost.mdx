You first have to create a mattermost app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Getting Credentials

Mattermost now uses bot accounts for better security.  So you can use their guide to create
your bot to get your token required for the credentials.yml file.

For more information on creating a bot account please see
[Bot Creation](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/bot-accounts.html#bot-account-creation).

For information on converting existing user account into bot account please see
[User Conversion](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/bot-accounts.html#how-do-i-convert-an-existing-account-to-a-bot-account).

**How to set up the outgoing webhook:**

1. To create the Mattermost outgoing webhook, login to your Mattermost
   team site and go to **Main Menu > Integrations > Outgoing Webhooks**.

2. Click **Add outgoing webhook**.

3. Fill out the details including the channel you want the bot in.
   You will need to ensure the **trigger words** section is set up
   with `@yourbotname` so that the bot doesn't trigger on everything
   that is said.

4. The **Content Type** must be set to `application/json`.

5. Make sure **trigger when** is set to value
   **first word matches a trigger word exactly**.

6. Add the Callback URL, which will
   look like `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/mattermost/webhook`, replacing
   the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa Open Source server.

For more detailed steps, visit the
[Mattermost docs](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/developer.html).

## Running on Mattermost

Add the Mattermost credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
mattermost:
  url: "https://chat.example.com/api/v4"
  token: "xxxxx" #  the token for the bot account from creating the bot step.
  webhook_url: "https://server.example.com/webhooks/mattermost/webhook"  # this should match the callback url from step 6
```


Restart your Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available for Mattermost to send messages to.
