description: Change the way Rasa imports training data by replacing the default importer or writing your own importer.
abstract: Rasa Open Source has built-in logic to collect and load training data written in Rasa format, but
  you can also customize how your training data gets imported using custom training data importers.
---

Using the [`--data` command line argument](command-line-interface.mdx) you can specify where Rasa should look
for training data on your disk. Rasa then loads any potential training files and uses
them to train your assistant.

If needed, you can also customize how Rasa imports training data.
Potential use cases for this might be:

* using a custom parser to load training data in other formats

* using different approaches to collect training data (e.g. loading them from different resources)

You can [write a custom importer](#writing-a-custom-importer) and instruct Rasa to use it by adding the section
`importers` to your configuration file and specifying the importer with its
full class path:

```yaml-rasa {2-4} title="config.yml"
importers:
- name: "module.CustomImporter"
  parameter1: "value"
  parameter2: "value2"
- name: "RasaFileImporter"
```

The `name` key is used to determine which importer should be loaded. Any extra
parameters are passed as constructor arguments to the loaded importer.

:::note
`TrainingDataImporter` and its subclasses contain no async methods since Rasa 3.0.
In order to migrate your custom importers and make them work with Rasa 3.0, you also need to
replace your async methods with synchronized ones.
Please see the [migration guide](migration-guide.mdx#rasa-2x-to-30) for more information.
:::

:::tip
You can specify multiple importers. Rasa will automatically merge their results.

:::

## RasaFileImporter (default)

By default Rasa uses the importer `RasaFileImporter`. If you want to use it on its
own, you don't have to specify anything in your configuration file.
If you want to use it together with other importers, add it to your
configuration file:

```yaml-rasa {5} title="config.yml"
importers:
- name: "module.CustomImporter"
  parameter1: "value"
  parameter2: "value2"
- name: "RasaFileImporter"
```

## MultiProjectImporter (experimental)

:::info New in 1.3
This feature is currently experimental and might change or be removed in the future.
Share your feedback on it in the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com) to help
us making this feature ready for production.

:::

With this importer you can train a model by combining multiple
reusable Rasa projects.
You might, for example, handle chitchat with one project and greet your users with
another. These projects can be developed in isolation, and then combined when you train
your assistant.

For example, consider the following directory structure:

```bash
.
├── config.yml
└── projects
    ├── GreetBot
    │   ├── data
    │   │   ├── nlu.yml
    │   │   └── stories.yml
    │   └── domain.yml
    └── ChitchatBot
        ├── config.yml
        ├── data
        │   ├── nlu.yml
        │   └── stories.yml
        └── domain.yml
```

Here the contextual AI assistant imports the `ChitchatBot` project which in turn
imports the `GreetBot` project. Project imports are defined in the configuration files of
each project.

To instruct Rasa to use the `MultiProjectImporter` module, you need add it to the `importers` list in your root `config.yml`.

```yaml-rasa title="./config.yml"
importers:
- name: MultiProjectImporter
```

Then, in the same file, specify which projects you want to import by adding them to the `imports` list.

```yaml-rasa title="./config.yml"
imports:
- projects/ChitchatBot
```

The configuration file of the `ChitchatBot` needs to reference `GreetBot`:

```yaml-rasa title="./ChitchatBot/config.yml"
imports:
- ../GreetBot
```

Since the `GreetBot` project does not specify further project to import, it doesn't need a `config.yml`.

Rasa uses paths relative from the configuration file to import projects.
These can be anywhere on your filesystem where file access is permitted.

During the training process Rasa will import all required training files, combine
them, and train a unified AI assistant. The training data is merged at
runtime, so no additional training data files are created.

:::caution Policies and NLU Pipelines
Rasa will use the policy and NLU pipeline configuration of the root project
directory during training. **Policy and NLU configurations of imported projects
will be ignored.**

:::

:::caution watch out for merging
Equal intents, entities, slots, responses, actions and forms will be merged,
e.g. if two projects have training data for an intent `greet`,
their training data will be combined.

## Writing a Custom Importer

If you are writing a custom importer, this importer has to implement the interface of
[`TrainingDataImporter`](reference/rasa/shared/importers/importer.md#trainingdataimporter-objects):

```python
from typing import Optional, Text, Dict, List, Union

import rasa
from rasa.shared.core.domain import Domain
from rasa.shared.nlu.interpreter import RegexInterpreter
from rasa.shared.core.training_data.structures import StoryGraph
from rasa.shared.importers.importer import TrainingDataImporter
from rasa.shared.nlu.training_data.training_data import TrainingData


class MyImporter(TrainingDataImporter):
    """Example implementation of a custom importer component."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        config_file: Optional[Text] = None,
        domain_path: Optional[Text] = None,
        training_data_paths: Optional[Union[List[Text], Text]] = None,
        **kwargs: Dict
    ):
        """Constructor of your custom file importer.

        Args:
            config_file: Path to configuration file from command line arguments.
            domain_path: Path to domain file from command line arguments.
            training_data_paths: Path to training files from command line arguments.
            **kwargs: Extra parameters passed through configuration in configuration file.
        """

        pass

    def get_domain(self) -> Domain:
        path_to_domain_file = self._custom_get_domain_file()
        return Domain.load(path_to_domain_file)

    def _custom_get_domain_file(self) -> Text:
        pass

    def get_stories(
        self,
        interpreter: "NaturalLanguageInterpreter" = RegexInterpreter(),
        exclusion_percentage: Optional[int] = None,
    ) -> StoryGraph:
        from rasa.shared.core.training_data.story_reader.yaml_story_reader import (
            YAMLStoryReader,
        )

        path_to_stories = self._custom_get_story_file()
        return YAMLStoryReader.read_from_file(path_to_stories, self.get_domain())

    def _custom_get_story_file(self) -> Text:
        pass

    def get_config(self) -> Dict:
        path_to_config = self._custom_get_config_file()
        return rasa.utils.io.read_config_file(path_to_config)

    def _custom_get_config_file(self) -> Text:
        pass

    def get_nlu_data(self, language: Optional[Text] = "en") -> TrainingData:
        from rasa.shared.nlu.training_data import loading

        path_to_nlu_file = self._custom_get_nlu_file()
        return loading.load_data(path_to_nlu_file)

    def _custom_get_nlu_file(self) -> Text:
        pass
```
