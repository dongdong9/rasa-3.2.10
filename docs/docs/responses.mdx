## Defining Responses


Responses go under the `responses` key in your domain file or in a separate "responses.yml" file. Each response name should start with `utter_`.
For example, you could add responses for greeting and saying goodbye under the response names `utter_greet` and `utter_bye`:

```yaml-rasa {4-8} title="domain.yml"
intents:
  - greet

responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hi there!"
  utter_bye:
  - text: "See you!"
```


If you are using [retrieval intents](glossary.mdx#retrieval-intent) in your assistant, you also need to add responses
for your assistant's replies to these intents:

```yaml-rasa {5-6,8-9}
intents:
  - chitchat

responses:
  utter_chitchat/ask_name:
  - text: Oh yeah, I am called the retrieval bot.

  utter_chitchat/ask_weather:
  - text: Oh, it does look sunny right now in Berlin.
```

:::note
Notice the special format of response names for retrieval intents. Each name starts with `utter_`, 
followed by the retrieval intent's name (here `chitchat`) and finally a suffix specifying 
the different response keys (here `ask_name` and `ask_weather`). See [the documentation for NLU 
training examples](./training-data-format.mdx#training-examples) to learn more.
:::

### Using Variables in Responses

You can use variables to insert information into responses.
Within a response, a variable is enclosed in curly brackets. For example, see the variable `name` below:

```yaml-rasa {3} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"
```

When the `utter_greet` response is used, Rasa automatically fills in the variable with the 
value found in the slot called `name`. If such a slot doesn't exist or is empty, the variable gets
filled with `None`.

Another way to fill in a variable is within a [custom action](./custom-actions.mdx).
In your custom action code, you can supply values to a response to fill in specific variables. 
If you're using the Rasa SDK for your action server,
you can pass a value for the variable as a keyword argument to [`dispatcher.utter_message`](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server/sdk-dispatcher):

```python {3}
dispatcher.utter_message(
    template="utter_greet",
    name="Sara"
)
```

If you use a [different custom action server](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server#other-action-servers), 
supply the values by adding extra parameters to the responses your server returns:

```json {8}
{
  "events":[
    ...
  ],
  "responses":[
    {
      "template":"utter_greet",
      "name":"Sara"
    }
  ]
}
```


### Response Variations

You can make your assistant's replies more interesting if you provide multiple response variations 
to choose from for a given response name:
```yaml-rasa {3-4} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How are you?"
  - text: "Hey, {name}. How is your day going?"
```
In this example, when `utter_greet` gets predicted as the next action, Rasa will randomly pick one 
of the two response variations to use.


### Channel-Specific Response Variations

To specify different response variations depending on which channel
the user is connected to, use channel-specific response variations.

In the following example, the `channel` key makes the first response variation channel-specific for 
the `slack` channel while the second variation is not channel-specific:

```yaml-rasa {4} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_ask_game:
  - text: "Which game would you like to play on Slack?"
    channel: "slack"
  - text: "Which game would you like to play?"
```

:::note
Make sure the value of the `channel` key matches the value returned by the `name()` method of your 
input channel. If you are using a built-in channel, this value will also match the channel name used
in your `credentials.yml` file.
:::

When your assistant looks for suitable response variations under a given response name, it will first 
try to choose from channel-specific variations for the current channel.
If there are no such variations, the assistant will choose from any response variations which are not
channel-specific.

In the above example, the second response variation has no `channel` specified and can be used by
your assistant for all channels other than `slack`.

:::caution
For each response, try to have at least one response variation without the `channel` key.
This allows your assistant to properly respond in all environments, such as in new channels, 
in the shell and in interactive learning.
:::


### Conditional Response Variations

Specific response variations can also be selected based on one or more slot values using a conditional
response variation. A conditional response variation is defined in the domain or responses YAML files
similarly to a standard response variation but with an additional `condition` key. This key specifies
a list of slot `name` and `value` constraints.

When a response is triggered during a dialogue, the constraints of each conditional response variation
are checked against the current dialogue state. If all constraint slot values are equal to the corresponding
slot values of the current dialogue state, the response variation is eligible to be used by your conversational
assistant.

:::note
The comparison of dialogue state slot values and constraint slot values is performed by the
equality "==" operator which requires the type of slot values to match too.
For example, if the constraint is specified as `value: true`, then the slot needs to be filled
with a boolean `true`, not the string `"true"`.
:::

In the following example, we will define one conditional response variation with one constraint,
that the `logged_in` slot is set to `true`:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
slots:
  logged_in:
    type: bool
    influence_conversation: False
    mappings:
    - type: custom
  name:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: False
    mappings:
    - type: custom

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - condition:
        - type: slot
          name: logged_in
          value: true
      text: "Hey, {name}. Nice to see you again! How are you?"

    - text: "Welcome. How is your day going?"
```

```yaml-rasa title="stories.yml"
stories:
- story: greet
  steps:
  - action: action_log_in
  - slot_was_set:
    - logged_in: true
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

In the example above, the first response variation (``"Hey, {name}. Nice to see you again! How are you?"``)
will be used whenever the `utter_greet` action is executed and the `logged_in` slot is set to `true`.
The second variation, which has no condition, will be treated as the default and used whenever
`logged_in` is not equal to `true`.

:::caution
It is highly recommended to always provide a default response variation without a condition
to guard against those cases when no conditional response matches filled slots.
:::

During a dialogue, Rasa will choose from all conditional response variations whose constraints are satisfied.
If there are multiple eligible conditional response variations, Rasa will pick one at random.
For example, consider the following response:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
    - condition:
        - type: slot
          name: logged_in
          value: true
      text: "Hey, {name}. Nice to see you again! How are you?"

    - condition:
        - type: slot
          name: eligible_for_upgrade
          value: true
      text: "Welcome, {name}. Did you know you are eligible for a free upgrade?"

    - text: "Welcome. How is your day going?"
```

If `logged_in` and `eligible_for_upgrade` are both set to `true` then both the first and second response
variations are eligible to be used, and will be chosen by the conversational assistant with equal probability.

You can continue using channel-specific response variations alongside conditional response variations
as shown in the example below.

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
slots:
  logged_in:
    type: bool
    influence_conversation: False
    mappings:
    - type: custom
  name:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: False
    mappings:
    - type: custom

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - condition:
        - type: slot
          name: logged_in
          value: true
      text: "Hey, {name}. Nice to see you again on Slack! How are you?"
      channel: slack

    - text: "Welcome. How is your day going?"
```

Rasa will prioritize the selection of responses in the following order:

1. conditional response variations with matching channel
2. default responses with matching channel
3. conditional response variations with no matching channel
4. default responses with no matching channel


## Rich Responses

You can make responses rich by adding visual and interactive elements.
There are several types of elements that are supported across many channels:

### Buttons

Here is an example of a response that uses buttons:

```yaml-rasa {4-8} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
    buttons:
    - title: "great"
      payload: "/mood_great"
    - title: "super sad"
      payload: "/mood_sad"
```

Each button in the list of `buttons` should have two keys:
* `title`: The text displayed on the buttons that the user sees.
* `payload`: The message sent from the user to the assistant when the button is clicked.

If you would like the buttons to also pass entities to the assistant:

```yaml-rasa {4-8} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! Would you like to purchase motor or home insurance?"
    buttons:
    - title: "Motor insurance"
      payload: '/inform{{"insurance":"motor"}}'
    - title: "Home insurance"
      payload: '/inform{{"insurance":"home"}}'
```

Passing multiple entities is also possible with:

```
'/intent_name{{"entity_type_1":"entity_value_1", "entity_type_2": "entity_value_2"}}'
```

:::note bypass nlu with buttons
You can use buttons to bypass NLU prediction and trigger a specific intent and entities.

Messages starting with `/` are sent straight to the
`RegexInterpreter`, which expects NLU input in a shortened `/intent{entities}` format.
In the example above, if the user clicks a button, the user input
will be directly classified as either the `mood_great` or `mood_sad` intent.

You can include entities with the intent to be passed to the `RegexInterpreter` using the following format:

`/inform{"ORG":"Rasa", "GPE":"Germany"}`

The `RegexInterpreter` will classify the message above with the intent `inform` and extract the entities
`Rasa` and `Germany` which are of type `ORG` and `GPE` respectively.

:::

:::note escaping curly braces in domain.yml
You need to write the `/intent{entities}` shorthand response with double curly braces in domain.yml so that the assistant does not
treat it as a [variable in a response](#using-variables-in-responses) and interpolate the content within the curly braces. 
:::

:::caution Check your channel
Keep in mind that it is up to the implementation of the output
channel how to display the defined buttons. For example, some
channels have a limit on the number of
buttons you can provide. Check your channel's documentation under
**Concepts > Channel Connectors** for any channel-specific restrictions.
:::

### Images

You can add images to a response by providing a URL to the image under the `image` key:

```yaml-rasa {3} title="domain.yml"
  utter_cheer_up:
  - text: "Here is something to cheer you up:"
    image: "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
```

### Custom Output Payloads

You can send any arbitrary output to the output channel using the
`custom` key. The output channel receives the object stored under the `custom` key
as a JSON payload.

Here's an example of how to send a
[date picker](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/block-elements#datepicker) to the
[Slack Output Channel](connectors/slack.mdx):

```yaml-rasa {3-14} title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_take_bet:
  - custom:
      blocks:
      - type: section
        text:
          text: "Make a bet on when the world will end:"
          type: mrkdwn
        accessory:
          type: datepicker
          initial_date: '2019-05-21'
          placeholder:
            type: plain_text
            text: Select a date
```

## Using Responses in Conversations

### Calling Responses as Actions

If the name of the response starts with `utter_`, the response can
directly be used as an action, without being listed in the `actions` section of your domain. You would add the response
to the domain:


```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
responses:
  utter_greet:
  - text: "Hey! How are you?"
```

You can use that same response as an action in your stories:

```yaml-rasa {5} title="stories.yml"
stories:
- story: greet user
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

When the `utter_greet` action runs, it will send the message from
the response back to the user.

:::note Changing responses
If you want to change the text, or any other part of the response,
you need to retrain the assistant before these changes will be picked up.
:::

### Calling Responses from Custom Actions


You can use the responses to generate response messages from your
custom actions. If you're using Rasa SDK as your action server, you can use the dispatcher to generate the response message, for example: 

```python {8} title="actions.py"
from rasa_sdk.interfaces import Action

class ActionGreet(Action):
    def name(self):
        return 'action_greet'

    def run(self, dispatcher, tracker, domain):
        dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_greet")
        return []
```

If you use a
[different custom action server](https://rasa.com/docs/action-server#other-action-servers),
your server should return the following JSON to call the `utter_greet` response:

```json {5}
{
  "events":[],
  "responses":[
    {
      "template":"utter_greet"
    }
  ]
}
```
