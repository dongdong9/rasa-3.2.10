description: Deploy a Rasa Open Source assistant through text message or WhatsApp via the Twilio connector
---

You can use the Twilio connector to deploy an assistant that is available over text message.

## Getting Credentials

You first have to create a Twilio app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

**How to get the Twilio credentials:**
You need to set up a Twilio account.

1. Once you have created a Twilio account, you need to create a new
   project. The basic important product to select here
   is `Programmable SMS`.

2. Once you have created the project, navigate to the Dashboard of
   `Programmable SMS` and click on `Get Started`. Follow the
   steps to connect a phone number to the project.

3. Now you can use the `Account SID`, `Auth Token`, and the phone
   number you purchased in your `credentials.yml`.

4. Configure your webhook URL by navigating to
   [Phone Numbers](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) in the Twilio
   dashboard and selecting your phone number. Find the `Messaging` section and add
   your webhook URL (e.g. `https://<host>:<port>/webhooks/twilio/webhook`,
   replacing the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa Open Source server)
   to the `A MESSAGE COMES IN` setting.

For more information, see the [Twilio REST API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api).

### Connecting to WhatsApp

You can deploy a Rasa Open Source assistant to WhatsApp through Twilio. However, to do so, you have
to have a [WhatsApp Business](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/) profile. Associate
your Whatsapp Business profile with the phone number you purchased through Twilio to
access the [Twilio API for WhatsApp](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api).

According to the [Twilio API documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/api#using-phone-numbers-with-whatsapp),
the phone number you use should be prefixed with whatsapp: in the `credentials.yml` described below.


## Running on Twilio

Add the Twilio credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
twilio:
  account_sid: "ACbc2dxxxxxxxxxxxx19d54bdcd6e41186"
  auth_token: "e231c197493a7122d475b4xxxxxxxxxx"
  twilio_number: "+440123456789"  # if using WhatsApp: "whatsapp:+440123456789"
```

Restart your Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available for Twilio to send messages to.
