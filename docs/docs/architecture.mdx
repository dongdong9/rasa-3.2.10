## Message Handling

This diagram shows the basic steps of how an assistant built with Rasa
responds to a message:

import archImage from './architecture-img.png';

<Image img={archImage} caption="Rasa Open Source architecture" alt="A visual representation of the steps that follow."/>

The steps are:

1. The message is received and passed to an `Interpreter`, which
   converts it into a dictionary including the original text, the intent,
   and any entities that were found. This part is handled by NLU.

2. The message is passed from the `Interpreter` to the `Tracker`.
   The `Tracker` is the object which keeps track of conversation state.

3. The current state of the tracker is sent to each policy.

4. Each policy chooses which action to take next.

5. The chosen action is logged by the tracker.

6. A response is sent to the user.
