You first have to create a Microsoft app to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

The endpoint URL that Microsoft Bot Framework should send messages to will
look like `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/botframework/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa Open Source server.


## Running on Microsoft Bot Framework

Add the Botframework credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
botframework:
  app_id: "MICROSOFT_APP_ID"
  app_password: "MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD"
```


Restart your Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available for Microsoft Bot Framework to send messages to.
