## Hangouts Chat Setup

This channel works similar to the standard Rasa REST channel. For each request from the channel, your bot will
send one response. The response will be displayed to the user either as text or a so-called card (for
more information, see the Cards section).

In order to connect your Rasa bot to Google Hangouts Chat, you first need to create a project in
Google Developer Console that includes the Hangouts API. There you can specify your bot's endpoint.
This endpoint should look like look like `https://<host>:<port>/webhooks/hangouts/webhook`, replacing
the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa Open Source server.

:::note configure https
Hangouts Chat only forwards
messages to endpoints via `https`, so take appropriate measures to add
it to your setup. For local testing of your bot, see [Testing Channels on Your Local Machine](../messaging-and-voice-channels.mdx#testing-channels-on-your-local-machine).
:::

In the Google Developer console, obtain your project id (also known as project number or app ID), which determines the scope for the OAuth2 authorization in case you
want to use OAuth2. The Hangouts Chat API sends a Bearer token with every request, but it is up to
the bot to actually verify the token, hence the channel also works without this.
For more information see the [Google Hangouts documentation](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat). If you want the verification to be done, be sure to include `project_id` inside your `credentials.yml` file as shown below.

The possibility to implement asynchronous communication between Hangouts Chat and bot exists, but due
to the usually synchronous nature of Rasa bots, this functionality is not included in this channel.

### Running On Hangouts Chat

Add the Hangouts credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
hangouts:
  # no credentials required here
```

If you want to use OAuth2, add the project id obtained from the Google Developer Console:

```yaml-rasa
hangouts:
  project_id: "12345678901"
```


Restart your Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available for Google Hangouts to send messages to.

### Cards and Interactive Cards

There are two ways in which Hangouts Chat will display bot messages, either as text or card. For each recevied
request, your bot will send all messages in one response. If one of those messages is a card (e.g. an image),
all other messages are converted to card format as well.

Interactive cards trigger the `CARD_CLICKED` event for user interactions, e.g. when a button is clicked. When
creating an interactive card, e.g. via `dispatcher.utter_button_message()` in your `actions.py`, you can
specify a payload for each button that is going to be returned with the `CARD_CLICKED` event and extracted
by the `HangoutsInput` channel (for example
`buttons=[{"text":"Yes!", "payload":"/affirm"}, {"text":"Nope.", "payload":"/deny"}])`.
Updating cards is not yet supported.

For more detailed information on cards, visit the
[Hangouts docs](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/reference).

### Other Hangouts Chat Events

Except for `MESSAGE` and `CARD_CLICKED`, Hangouts Chat knows two other event types, `ADDED_TO_SPACE` and
`REMOVED_FROM_SPACE`, which are triggered when your bot is added or removed from a direct message or chat room
space. The default intent names for these events can be modified in the `HangoutsInput` constructor method.
