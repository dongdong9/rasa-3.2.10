  Models can be stored in different places after you trained your assistant. This
  page explains how to configure Rasa to load your models.
---

You can load your trained model in three different ways:

1. Load the model from your local disk (see [Load Model from Disk](./model-storage.mdx#load-model-from-disk))

2. Fetch the model from your own HTTP server (see [Load Model from Server](./model-storage.mdx#load-model-from-server))

3. Fetch the model from cloud storage like S3 (see [Load Model from Cloud](./model-storage.mdx#load-model-from-cloud))

By default all commands of Rasa's CLI will load models from your local disk.

## Load Model from Disk

By default models will be loaded from your local disk. You can specify the path
to your model with the `--model` parameter:

```bash
rasa run --model models/20190506-100418.tar.gz
```

If you want to load the latest model in a directory, you can specify
a directory instead of a file:

```bash
rasa run --model models/
```

Rasa Open Source will check all the models in that directory and load the one that was trained
most recently.

If you don't specify a `--model` argument, Rasa Open Source will look for models in the  `models/` directory. The two following calls
will load the same model:

```bash
# this command will load the same model
rasa run --model models/
# ... as this command (using defaults)
rasa run
```

## Load Model from Server

You can configure the Rasa Open Source server to regularly fetch
a model from a server and deploy it.

### How to Configure Rasa Open Source

You can configure the HTTP server to fetch models from another URL
by adding it to your `endpoints.yml`:

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
models:
  url: http://my-server.com/models/default
  wait_time_between_pulls: 10   # In seconds, optional, default: 100
```
The server will query the `url` for a zipped model every `wait_time_between_pulls`
seconds.

If you want to pull the model only when starting up the server, you can set the time
between pulls to `null`:

```yaml-rasa title="endpoints.yml"
models:
  url: http://my-server.com/models/default
  wait_time_between_pulls: null  # fetches model only once
```

### How to Configure Your Server

Rasa Open Source will send a `GET` request to the URL you specified in the
`endpoints.yml`, e.g. `http://my-server.com/models/default` in the above examples.
You can use any URL.
The `GET` request will contain an `If-None-Match` header that contains the
model hash of the last model it downloaded. An example request from Rasa Open
Source to your server would look like this:

```bash
curl --header "If-None-Match: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e" http://my-server.com/models/default
```

The response of your server to this `GET` request should be one of these:
- a status code of `200`, a zipped Rasa Model and set the `ETag` header in
  the response to the hash of the model.
- a status code of `304` and an empty response if the `If-None-Match`
  header of the request matches the model you want your server to return.

Rasa Open Source uses the `If-None-Match` and `ETag` headers for caching. Setting
the headers will avoid re-downloading the same model over and over, saving
bandwidth and compute resources.

## Load Model from Cloud

You can also configure the Rasa server to fetch your model from a remote storage:

```bash
rasa run --model 20190506-100418.tar.gz --remote-storage aws
```

The zipped model will be downloaded from cloud storage, unzipped, and deployed.
Rasa supports loading models from:
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/),
- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) and
- custom implementations for
  [Other Remote Storages](./model-storage.mdx#other-remote-storages).

Models need to be stored in the root folder of the storage service. Currently, it is
not possible to manually specify the path on the cloud storage.

### Amazon S3 Storage

Amazon S3 is supported using the `boto3` package which you need to install
as an additional dependency using `pip3`:
```bash
pip3 install boto3
```

For Rasa to be able to authenticate and download the model, you need to set the
following environment variables before running any command requiring the storage:

* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: environment variable containing your AWS S3 secret access key

* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: environment variable containing your AWS S3 access key ID

* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: environment variable specifying the region of your AWS S3 bucket

* `BUCKET_NAME`: environment variable specifying the S3 bucket

* `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL`: The complete URL to use for the AWS S3 requests. You need to
  specify a complete URL (including the "http/https" scheme).


Once all environment variables are set, you can start the Rasa server with
`remote-storage` option set to `aws`:

```bash
rasa run --model 20190506-100418.tar.gz --remote-storage aws
```

### Google Cloud Storage

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is supported using the `google-cloud-storage` package
which you need to install as an additional dependency using `pip3`:
```bash
pip3 install google-cloud-storage
```

If you are running Rasa on Google App Engine or Compute Engine, the auth
credentials are already set up (for the GCS in the same project). In this case,
you can skip setting any additional environment variables.

If you are running locally or on a machine outside of GAE or GCE you need to
provide the authentication details to Rasa manually:
1. Check out the [GCS documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#auth-cloud-implicit-python)
   and follow the descriptions on "Creating a service account" and
   "Setting the environment variable."
2. After you have completed the GCS instructions, you should have set an environment
   variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the path of a service account
   key file with access to your GCS.

Once all environment variable is set, you can start the Rasa server with
`remote-storage` option set to `gcs`:

```bash
rasa run --model 20190506-100418.tar.gz --remote-storage gcs
```

### Azure Storage

Azure Storage is supported using the `azure-storage-blob` package which you need
to install as an additional dependency using `pip3`:
```bash
pip3 install azure-storage-blob
```

For Rasa to be able to authenticate and download the model, you need to set the
following environment variables before running any command requiring the storage:

* `AZURE_CONTAINER`: environment variable containing your azure container name

* `AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: environment variable containing your azure account name

* `AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: environment variable containing your account key

Once all environment variables are set, you can start the Rasa server with
`remote-storage` option set to `azure`:

```bash
rasa run --model 20190506-100418.tar.gz --remote-storage azure
```

### Other Remote Storages

If you want to use any other Cloud Storage, you can provide your own python
implementation of the [`rasa.nlu.persistor.Persistor`](/reference/rasa/nlu/persistor) class.

You can start the Rasa server with `remote-storage` option set to
the module path of your persistor implementation:

```bash
rasa run --remote-storage <your module>.<class name>
```
